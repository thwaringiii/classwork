Class project that takes input characters, turns them into tokens, and exchanges their value
with information the project understands. The output tells whether the algebraic expression
has been entered in a valid form. The expression itself is not solved for its variables.

Some of the initial code was provided by the professor to allow the most basic expressions
to be evaluated. Anything more complicated than "4 - 6" was on us to work through.
Specifically, Buffer.java and initial parts of Lexer.java/Token.java were provided.
